# MANDATORY WORKFLOW POLICY v5.0
**ABSOLUTE SYSTEM OVERRIDES - NON-NEGOTIABLE CONSTRAINTS**

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETENESS OVERRIDE:
- When core functionality is missing (APIs, endpoints, database methods), implement it fully rather than working around it
- Missing backend functionality MUST be treated as required work, not obstacles to avoid
- Creating necessary files/endpoints for core functionality is ALWAYS "truly important"
- Don't seek permission for implementing missing pieces that are clearly needed for the feature to work
- ALWAYS Prefer complete implementation over workarounds, even if it requires more files/changes

UPDATED MANDATORY WORK PHASES
Phase 1: Discover
- Use read to understand existing code patterns and conventions (read, ls, glob,grep)
- Use ls to understand project structure
- Read large chunks (500+ lines) for better context
- Always map out the full system requirements before writing any code
- Check both frontend AND backend implications
- Don't start implementing until I understand the complete scope

Phase 2: Planning
- Map ALL information needed (files to read, searches to do) before starting
- Map ALL changes to make (edits, database updates, new files)

Phase 3: Execution
Parallel tool and function calls: When operations are independent (multi_edit)
Sequential calls: When later calls depend on earlier results (edit)

Phase 4: Verification
When HMR confirms no errors -> SUCCESS

Following tools are permanently DISABLED AND USE IS PROHIBITED:

Code Analysis & Search = DISABLED
search_codebase, USAGE PROHIBITED; DO NOT USE;
get_latest_lsp_diagnostics

Task & Project Management = DISABLED:
write_task_list
read_task_list
start_subagent
architect

Development Environment = DISABLED:
restart_workflow
refresh_all_logs
packager_tool
programming_language_install_tool
check_secrets
ask_secrets

Database Operations = DISABLED:
create_postgresql_database_tool
check_database_status
execute_sql_tool

External Services & Search = DISABLED:
web_search
web_fetch
search_integrations
use_integration
search_replit_docs
stock_image_tool

User Interaction & Deployment = DISABLED:
mark_completed_and_get_feedback
suggest_deploy
suggest_rollback

**MANDATORY** Key Optimization Opportunities:
Parallel Tool Calls: Use independent tools simultaneously (read multiple files, search + grep, etc.)
Right Tool Selection: Use search_codebase instead of manual file reading when unsure of file locations
Subagent Delegation: Use start_subagent for complex multi-step tasks to reduce context window
Architect Reviews: Call architect before marking tasks complete for code quality assurance
LSP Diagnostics: Proactively check for errors after code changes
Efficient File Operations: Use multi_edit instead of multiple edit calls on same file

## Overview

This project is a full-stack React chat widget application featuring an Express.js backend and a React frontend. Its primary purpose is to provide an embeddable customer support chat widget for any website. The widget supports rich messaging, including text, interactive cards, menus, and quick replies, aiming to offer a comprehensive and customizable communication tool for businesses. The vision is to enable seamless integration of sophisticated chat functionalities, enhancing user engagement and support capabilities across various web platforms.


## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Like talking to a software developer, technical and detailed.

### Notes for agent

For server routes, create modular structure with separation of concerns
Use modular design for features
UI design choices should be mobile first unless stated otherwise.
If you need to use OpenAI models, model "gpt-4.1" is the newest model released on 14.4.2025




# ContentCraft AI

## Overview
ContentCraft AI is an AI-powered social media content strategist delivered as a full-stack web application. It offers a chat interface for AI-driven content brainstorming, platform-specific advice, and strategic planning. The project aims to enhance social media presence and content creation efficiency for marketers and content creators by integrating sophisticated chat functionalities and providing a comprehensive tool for strategic content development.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: like talking to a software developer, technical and detailed.

## System Architecture
### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript and Vite for a modern development experience.
- **UI/UX**: Utilizes Radix UI, shadcn/ui, and Tailwind CSS to ensure a responsive, mobile-first design and consistent user experience.
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) manages server-side state and caching for efficient data handling.
- **Routing**: Wouter provides lightweight client-side routing.

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js and TypeScript (ES modules) forms the core of the backend.
- **API**: A RESTful JSON API is implemented with robust error handling.
- **Key Features**: Includes Replit OIDC authentication, CRUD operations for conversations and messages, and integrates OpenAI GPT-4o for streaming AI responses.
- **Deployment**: The application is designed for single-process deployment, serving both the API and the Single Page Application (SPA), with hot module replacement during development for rapid iteration.

### Data Layer
- **Database**: PostgreSQL is used as the primary data store, leveraging Neon serverless for scalable connections.
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM ensures type-safe interactions with the database.
- **Schema**: Shared TypeScript schema definitions with Zod validation maintain data consistency across the stack.
- **Persistence**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions are managed using `connect-pg-simple`, employing a dual storage strategy (memory for development, database for production).

### AI Services
- **Intent Analysis**: Advanced AI models determine user intent, enabling dynamic triggering of various AI workflows such as web search, Instagram analysis, blog analysis, and profile updates.
- **Content Generation**: Leverages OpenAI GPT-4o for generating chat responses, conversation titles, and extracting user profile information and memories.
- **Memory Management**: AI-driven rephrasing of queries and extraction of memories from conversations to enhance context and personalize interactions.
- **Workflow Management**: Analyzes user writing style and builds workflow-aware system prompts to guide users through content creation processes.

## External Dependencies
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: For PostgreSQL database connectivity.
- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe ORM for database interactions.
- **openai**: Integration with OpenAI's GPT-4o for AI capabilities.
- **Perplexity API**: Provides web search functionalities to enrich AI responses with real-time information.
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Used for server state management in the frontend.
- **@radix-ui/***: A collection of unstyled, accessible UI components.
- **tailwindcss**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling.
