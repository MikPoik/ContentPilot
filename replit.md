# MANDATORY WORKFLOW POLICY v5.0
**ABSOLUTE SYSTEM OVERRIDES - NON-NEGOTIABLE CONSTRAINTS**

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETENESS OVERRIDE:
- When core functionality is missing (APIs, endpoints, database methods), implement it fully rather than working around it
- Missing backend functionality MUST be treated as required work, not obstacles to avoid
- Creating necessary files/endpoints for core functionality is ALWAYS "truly important"
- Don't seek permission for implementing missing pieces that are clearly needed for the feature to work
- ALWAYS Prefer complete implementation over workarounds, even if it requires more files/changes
- Trace to source, not symptoms - Find the actual originating file/function, not just where errors surface
- For server routes, create modular structure with separation of concerns
- Use modular design for features
- UI design choices should be mobile first unless stated otherwise.
- If you need to use OpenAI models, model "gpt-4.1" is the newest model released on 14.4.2025


UPDATED MANDATORY WORK PHASES
Phase 1: Discover
- Use read to understand existing code patterns and conventions (read, ls, glob, grep,rg)
- Use ls to understand project structure if unsure `ls -R client server shared | grep -vE "\.config|\.git|attached_assets|node_modules|\.upm|^\.|dist|build"`
- Read large chunks (500+ lines) for better context
- Always map out the full system requirements before writing any code
- Check both frontend AND backend implications
- Don't start implementing until I understand the complete scope

Phase 2: Planning
- Map ALL information needed (files to read, searches to do) before starting
- Map ALL changes to make (edits, database updates, new files)
- Map ALL function_calls for aggressive batching

Phase 3: Execution
- Parallel tool and function calls: When operations are independent (multi_edit)
- Sequential calls: When later calls depend on earlier results (edit,write)
- **Fully implement features instead leaving TODO log entries as a shortcut.**
- Fix the pattern, not just the instance
- Always prefer dynamic solutions instead of hardcoded patterns, for example keyword string matching

Phase 4: Verification
- When HMR confirms no errors -> SUCCESS

Following tools are permanently DISABLED:

Code Analysis & Search = DISABLED
search_codebase
get_latest_lsp_diagnostics

Task & Project Management = DISABLED:
write_task_list
read_task_list
start_subagent
architect

Development Environment = DISABLED:
refresh_all_logs
packager_tool
programming_language_install_tool
check_secrets
ask_secrets

Database Operations = DISABLED:
check_database_status

External Services & Search = DISABLED:
web_search
web_fetch
search_integrations
use_integration
search_replit_docs
stock_image_tool

User Interaction & Deployment = DISABLED:
mark_completed_and_get_feedback
suggest_deploy
suggest_rollback

**MANDATORY** Key Optimization Opportunities:
- Parallel Tool Calls: Use independent tools simultaneously within single function_calls block (read multiple files, search + grep, etc.)
- Efficient File Operations: Use multi_edit instead of multiple edit calls on same file
- For UI issues:** Read component + parent + related hooks/state
- For API issues:** Read routes + services + storage + schema
- For data issues:** Read schema + storage + related API endpoints
- For feature additions:** Read similar existing implementations

# ContentCraft AI

## Overview
ContentCraft AI is an AI-powered social media content strategist delivered as a full-stack web application. It offers a chat interface for AI-driven content brainstorming, platform-specific advice, and strategic planning. The project aims to enhance social media presence and content creation efficiency for marketers and content creators by integrating sophisticated chat functionalities and providing a comprehensive tool for strategic content development.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: like talking to a software developer, technical and detailed.

## System Architecture
### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript and Vite for a modern development experience.
- **UI/UX**: Utilizes Radix UI, shadcn/ui, and Tailwind CSS to ensure a responsive, mobile-first design and consistent user experience.
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) manages server-side state and caching for efficient data handling.
- **Routing**: Wouter provides lightweight client-side routing.

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js and TypeScript (ES modules) forms the core of the backend.
- **API**: A RESTful JSON API is implemented with robust error handling.
- **Key Features**: Includes Replit OIDC authentication, CRUD operations for conversations and messages, and integrates OpenAI GPT-4o for streaming AI responses.
- **Deployment**: The application is designed for single-process deployment, serving both the API and the Single Page Application (SPA), with hot module replacement during development for rapid iteration.

### Data Layer
- **Database**: PostgreSQL is used as the primary data store, leveraging Neon serverless for scalable connections.
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM ensures type-safe interactions with the database.
- **Schema**: Shared TypeScript schema definitions with Zod validation maintain data consistency across the stack.
- **Persistence**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions are managed using `connect-pg-simple`, employing a dual storage strategy (memory for development, database for production).

### AI Services
- **Intent Analysis**: Advanced AI models determine user intent, enabling dynamic triggering of various AI workflows such as web search, Instagram analysis, blog analysis, and profile updates.
- **Content Generation**: Leverages OpenAI GPT-4o for generating chat responses, conversation titles, and extracting user profile information and memories.
- **Memory Management**: AI-driven rephrasing of queries and extraction of memories from conversations to enhance context and personalize interactions.
- **Workflow Management**: Analyzes user writing style and builds workflow-aware system prompts to guide users through content creation processes.

## External Dependencies
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: For PostgreSQL database connectivity.
- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe ORM for database interactions.
- **openai**: Integration with OpenAI's GPT-4o for AI capabilities.
- **Perplexity API**: Provides web search functionalities to enrich AI responses with real-time information.
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Used for server state management in the frontend.
- **@radix-ui/***: A collection of unstyled, accessible UI components.
- **tailwindcss**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling.
