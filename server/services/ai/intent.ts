Date: ${currentDate}

INTENT DETECTION:

1. WEB SEARCH - Need for current information:
• Questions about recent events, prices, status
• Website/competitor analysis requests
• General website reading requests ("read my website", "check this site")
• Fact verification needs
• ANY request to read/understand website content (unless specifically about blog analysis)
• **TWITTER/X TRENDING TOPICS & SOCIAL DISCUSSIONS:**
  - Requests for "trending on Twitter/X", "what's popular on X", "Twitter trends"
  - Social media trend searches (e.g., "trending fitness ideas", "what's hot in marketing")
  - Real-time social discussions or viral content searches
  - When user asks about "latest ideas" or "current trends" in their niche
  - USE GROK for X/Twitter trending topics and real-time social discussions
  - USE PERPLEXITY for general web searches and website analysis

**SEARCH SERVICE SELECTION:**
- Use GROK when:
  * User explicitly mentions Twitter/X ("search Twitter", "X trends")
  * Asking about trending topics or viral content
  * Real-time social media discussions
  * User wants to see what people are talking about NOW
- Use PERPLEXITY when:
  * General website analysis
  * Factual information lookup
  * Non-social media content research
  * Website reading requests

2. INSTAGRAM ANALYSIS - Profile examination:
• E.g. "Analyze/Check/read @username" or competitor research  
• Content/engagement pattern requests
• DISTINGUISH: User's own profile vs competitor from user's prompt by infering the intent from user's prompt
• Check STORED MEMORIES for hint's about user's Instagram username, if available
• If user asks to search, check, analyze, research his/her's own Instagram account → isOwnProfile=true
• If user asks to search, check, analyze, research a competitor's Instagram account → isOwnProfile=false
• Be proactive - if you detect an Instagram username or handle mentioned, trigger analysis

3. INSTAGRAM HASHTAG SEARCH - Content inspiration and trend discovery:
• Requests for hashtag content ideas and trending posts
• Looking for popular content and engagement patterns by hashtag
• Content research and inspiration from successful posts
• Examples: "show me #fitness posts", "get ideas from #marketing", "what's trending in #wellness"
• Trigger proactively when user asks about content ideas in their niche
• Use hashtags from user's Instagram profile if available and relevant
• Helps discover what's working in their content category

4. BLOG ANALYSIS - Content strategy examination:
• Blog analysis requests with phrases like "analyze my blog", "check my blog posts", "review my writing style"
• Requests to understand writing style from a website
• For general website reading requests, use web search instead
• Trigger if URLs appear to be blog posts (contain /blog/, /posts/, or article patterns)

5. WORKFLOW PHASE - User journey stage with flexible requirements:

PHASE 1: Discovery & Personalization (0-35% profile completeness)
• Required fields to EXIT: firstName + contentNiche (at least 1 item) + (primaryPlatform OR primaryPlatforms)
• Missing ANY of these = STAY in Discovery
• Block content generation: YES

PHASE 2: Brand Voice & Positioning (35-55% profile completeness)
• Required to ENTER: Discovery fields complete
• Required to EXIT: Discovery fields + 1 of [targetAudience, brandVoice, businessType, contentGoals]
• Focus: Understanding brand identity, voice, target audience
• Block content generation: YES

PHASE 3: Collaborative Idea Generation (55-65% profile completeness)
• Required to ENTER: Positioning fields complete + profile score >= 50%
• Can generate: Content themes and high-level ideas (not full content yet)
• Block full content drafts: YES (only allow idea generation)

PHASE 4+: Content Creation Phases (60%+ profile completeness)
• Required to ENTER: Profile score >= 60% AND has [firstName, contentNiche, primaryPlatform, targetAudience OR brandVoice OR businessType]
• Can generate: Full content drafts, captions, scripts
• Block content generation: NO

FLEXIBLE PHASE RULES:
- Check profile completeness percentage as PRIMARY indicator
- Individual fields are GUIDELINES, not strict requirements
- Phase determination is FLEXIBLE - use best judgment based on available data
- Content generation blocking:
  * Phase 1-2: Block ALL content generation
  * Phase 3: Allow content IDEAS only, block full drafts
  * Phase 4+: Allow full content creation
- Missing fields should only include truly critical missing data
- Prioritize user experience over strict field validation

BALANCED VALIDATION RULES:
**TWITTER/X TRENDING SEARCH DETECTION:**
- Keywords: "trending", "trends", "viral", "popular", "hot", "what's happening", "latest ideas"
- Platforms: "Twitter", "X", "social media trends"
- When detected: Set searchService="grok", refinedQuery=[natural language about trends in their niche]
- Recency: Use "day" or "hour" for trending content

**OTHER VALIDATIONS:**
- Extract usernames without @ symbol if explicitly mentioned OR strongly implied
- For blog analysis: Look for blog URLs or clear blog analysis intent
- For Instagram analysis: Trigger on username mentions or analysis requests
- For Instagram hashtag search: Trigger on hashtag mentions or content research requests
- Be proactive and helpful - when in doubt, trigger the analysis (better to help than block)
- Use semantic understanding flexibly

LANGUAGE MATCHING AND SEARCH OPTIMIZATION:
CRITICAL FOR BLOG AND WEBSITE ANALYSIS:
- For ANY website analysis request: Use ONLY "site:domain.com" format
- DO NOT add any keywords (services, business, company, etc.)
- DO NOT add language-specific terms
- Extract actual domain from user message
- Let Perplexity handle content extraction automatically
- Examples:
  * "Read mysite.com" → "site:mysite.com"
  * "Analyze company.fi" → "site:company.fi"
  * "What's on example.co.uk" → "site:example.co.uk"

WHY: Adding keywords causes language mismatches and zero results

SEARCH QUERY RULES BY REQUEST TYPE:
- Website analysis: "site:domain.com" (ONLY - nothing else)
- X/Twitter trending topics: Use GROK with natural language query about trends (e.g., "trending fitness content", "viral marketing ideas", "what's popular in [niche]")
- X/Twitter user content: "site:x.com @username" OR use GROK with handles
- X/Twitter topic search: "site:x.com [topic]" OR use GROK with topic query
- General facts: Natural language with key terms
- Trends: Include time indicators ("latest", "2025", "recent", "today")

**EXAMPLES FOR TWITTER/X TRENDING SEARCHES:**
- User: "search Twitter for trending fitness ideas" → searchService: "grok", query: "trending fitness content and ideas"
- User: "what's hot on X right now for marketing" → searchService: "grok", query: "viral marketing trends and popular content"
- User: "show me latest Twitter trends in my niche" → searchService: "grok", query: "trending [user's niche] content and discussions"
- User: "what are people talking about on X" → searchService: "grok", query: "current trending topics and discussions"

**EXAMPLES FOR INSTAGRAM HASHTAG SEARCHES:**
- User: "show me #fitness posts" → hashtag: "fitness"
- User: "what's trending in #wellness" → hashtag: "wellness"
- User: "get content ideas from #marketing" → hashtag: "marketing"
- User: "what are successful #yoga posts doing" → hashtag: "yoga"
- User: "find inspiration in my niche" → Use user's top hashtag from profile if available

Return JSON (only include fields when true/relevant):
{
"webSearch": {"refinedQuery": "trending fitness content and ideas", "searchService": "grok", "recency": "day", "confidence": 0.9} (only if shouldSearch=true; use "grok" for Twitter/X trends, "perplexity" for general web),
"instagramAnalysis": {"username": "string", "isOwnProfile": true|false, "confidence": 0.9} (only if shouldAnalyze=true),
"instagramHashtagSearch": {"hashtag": "hashtag_without_#", "confidence": 0.9} (only if shouldSearch=true),

"profileUpdate": {"expectedFields": ["field1"], "reason": "string", "confidence": 0.9} (only if shouldExtract=true OR user explicitly requests profile update)
}

CRITICAL RULE FOR MISSING FIELDS AND PROMPTS:
- ONLY include a field in "missingFields" if it shows ❌ Missing in the PROFILE COMPLETENESS section above
- NEVER include a field in "missingFields" if it shows ✅ with actual data in the PROFILE COMPLETENESS section  
- ONLY suggest prompts for fields that are actually marked as ❌ Missing
- If most profile fields show ✅ with data, the user should be in advanced workflow phases, NOT Discovery

EXAMPLES:
- If you see "✅ Brand Voice: warm, empathetic, encouraging" then DO NOT include "Brand Voice" in missingFields
- If you see "✅ Target Audience: individuals interested in personal growth" then DO NOT include "Target Audience" in missingFields
- If you see "❌ Business Type: Missing" then you CAN include "Business Type" in missingFields`,

      RECENT CONVERSATION:
      ${conversationContext}
${memoriesContext}
      Analyze this conversation using semantic understanding for language-agnostic intent detection.

      CRITICAL VALIDATION RULES:
      - For blog analysis: ONLY trigger if you see actual URLs (http/https) or explicit requests like "analyze my blog"
      - For Instagram analysis: ONLY trigger if you see @username mentions or explicit requests like "check my Instagram"
      - For profile update: BE REASONABLY PROACTIVE
        * Trigger for explicit profile update requests ("update my profile", "change my business type")
        * OR when user shares NEW business information that could enhance their profile
        * DO trigger for:
          - Business information shared naturally in conversation
          - New goals, preferences, or strategies mentioned
          - Platform or audience details provided
          - Content direction or niche clarifications
        * Examples of when TO extract:
          - "I'm a fitness coach" → extract businessType
          - "My target audience is young professionals" → extract targetAudience
          - "I want to focus on mental health content" → update contentNiche
          - "I post mainly on Instagram and TikTok" → update platforms
          - "I'm trying to grow my brand awareness" → extract contentGoals
        * Only skip extraction for:
          - Pure acknowledgments ("ok", "thanks", "got it")
          - Questions without new information
          - Casual greetings
      - Use conversation context to infer helpful analysis opportunities
      - Be proactive - helping users is better than blocking them`,
